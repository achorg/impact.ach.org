While most of their communities were never built, geometric utopians distributed their plans as a form of visual rhetoric to convince and inspire potential converts. While past scholarship has framed geometric utopian communities as part of a larger emerging ideology that regarded the built environment as capable of shaping bodies and minds, the book argues that geometric utopians invented a radical aesthetic that allowed them to critically interrogate and visualize the emerging capitalist world as part of a larger effort to remake it.</p>", "MN5", "Omar", "Ilhan", "Democrat", "https://omar.house.gov", "1730 Longworth House Office Building Washington DC 20515-2305", "202-225-4755", "Klobuchar", "Amy", "Democrat", "https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov", "425 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington DC 20510", "202-224-3244", "https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/contact", "SenAmyKlobuchar", "", "Smith", "Tina", "Democrat", "https://www.smith.senate.gov", "720 Hart Senate Office Building Washington DC 20510", "202-224-5641", "https://www.smith.senate.gov/share-your-opinion/", "SenTinaSmith", "USSenTinaSmith"], ["DR30165124", "44.971814", "-93.233696", "Open access edition of Black Bourgeois: Class and Sex in the Flesh by Candice M.

Munda languages constitute the westernmost, and typologically most divergent, subgroup of the Austroasiatic language family.  There are at least twelve Munda languages, spoken in the area of northern India and Bangladesh, ranging in speaker population from those with a few million speakers (Santali) to those with under 10,000 (most languages of southern Odisha).  The structures of Munda languages make them very distinct from their sister languages spoken in Mainland Southeast Asia. Contemporary researchers of the Munda language family acknowledge that we have an incomplete picture of even the basic analytic units of the prosodic and phonological systems of even some of the best documented Munda languages. Even today, the quality of the data available to base generalizations upon is lacking for most Munda languages. Besides providing a fundamental and systematic documentation of these seriously endangered languages, we will use the data we gather to advance typological and historical research on the Munda and Austroasiatic language families. We will develop the Munda Virtual Archive, which will offer access to comparative linguistic data on the seven targeted languages.

The inclusion of short films in the AFI Catalog will allow us to look behind the veil of historical bias to reveal the true diversity of America\u2019s cultural legacy and bring marginalized artists into view.</p>", "CA30", "Friedman", "Laura", "Democrat", "https://friedman.house.gov", "1517 Longworth House Office Building Washington DC 20515-0530", "202-225-4176", "Padilla", "Alejandro", "Democrat", "https://www.padilla.senate.gov", "331 Hart Senate Office Building Washington DC 20510", "202-224-3553", "https://www.padilla.senate.gov/contact/", "SenAlexPadilla", "", "Schiff", "Adam", "Democrat", "https://www.schiff.senate.gov", "112 Hart Senate Office Building Washington DC 20510", "202-224-3841", "", "", ""], ["PW28514622", "34.020221", "-118.286035", "Understanding Change: The Los Angeles County Demographic Data Project", "7/1/2022 - 6/30/2025", "University of Southern California", "CA", "Urban History", "AHA", "History", "Humanities Collections and Reference Resources", "Preservation and Access", "50000", "<p>A Foundations project to plan for the accessibility of a dataset documenting demographics and social change in the City of Los Angeles and 86 Los Angeles County municipalities between 1950 and 2010. </p>\\r\\n<p>Our Foundations project will preserve and make accessible a remarkable dataset tracing many aspects of social change in the City of Los Angeles and 86 L.A.

The volume will provide a much-needed resource for fire researchers, practitioners, and teachers and a roadmap for innovative interdisciplinary humanities work in our current moment of ecological crisis.</p>", "ID1", "Fulcher", "Russ", "Republican", "https://fulcher.house.gov", "1514 Longworth House Office Building Washington DC 20515-1201", "202-225-6611", "Crapo", "Michael", "Republican", "https://www.crapo.senate.gov", "239 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington DC 20510", "202-224-6142", "https://www.crapo.senate.gov/contact", "MikeCrapo", "mikecrapo", "Risch", "James", "Republican", "https://www.risch.senate.gov", "483 Russell Senate Office Building Washington DC 20510", "202-224-2752", "https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=Email", "SenatorRisch", "senatorjimrisch"], ["RZ30023724", "36.150406", "-86.791598", "Memory and Memorialization of Roger Williams HBCU at Vanderbilt\u2019s Campus, 1866-1929", "10/1/2024 - 9/30/2025", "Vanderbilt University", "TN", "African American Studies", "Association for the Study of African American Life and History", "African-American Studies", "Collaborative Research", "Research Programs", "49989", "<p>Planning and holding a symposium on the history and\\nmemorialization of Roger Williams University, an institution of higher education\\nfor freed Black persons that was established in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1866 and destroyed by arson in 1905.\\n(12 months)</p>\\r\\n<p>Roger Williams University (RWU) was a Reconstruction-era institution for the education of freed persons.

It will probe the role of the Black press in WWII and how it reacted to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki through the prism of race.

Shirley Clarke (1919-1927) was a groundbreaking artist and a leader of the movement that created independent film in the United States. She declared war on Hollywood by telling stories about people who had always been excluded from the big screen. Black stories. Gay stories. True stories. She was the only American woman to win recognition for her independent films in the 1960s. But then she was almost excluded herself, written out of film history. In our film, her contributions and extraordinary life come back to life. A timely tale of cool, identity, and struggle in New York City, Cannes, and Los Angeles, from the 1950s to the 1980s.
